# mintest mods

various modes for Minetest. Use at own risk!

New, but incomplete:

- signalbox - basically mesecon switches on steroids to be used on railway signal boxes to switch tracks
- lowtech - low level technology (e.g. grindstone)
- geodesy - tools for measuring world

Old, but working:

- geld - creates multiple currencies, including soviet rouble (with hammer and sickle)
- kct - adds various small items, mainly Czech hiking markers symbols

Broken, because they are from stone age:

- archaelogy - randomly spawns churches and stone crosses when generating landscape
- asciiart - sort of wordbuilder but with ascii art files
- asphalt - creating asphalt from rotten food
